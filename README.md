# Portfolio Website - https://valay17.github.io/Portfolio/

This is the repository for my personal portfolio website, where I showcase my skills, projects, and experience. The website is designed to highlight my work as a developer and provide a user-friendly experience for anyone visiting to learn more about the projects I've worked on.

## Features

- **Transparency, Shrink, and Sticky Navbar:** The navbar remains fixed at the top, shrinks when scrolling, and has a transparent effect when at the top of the page.
- **Dark/Light Theme:** A toggle feature allowing users to switch between dark and light modes. Important for my fellow Dark Mode Devs!
- **Responsive Mobile & Desktop Views:** The website adjusts its layout to ensure an optimal viewing experience across devices, from mobile phones to desktops.
- **Click Listener for Menubar:** A click listener is added to close the menu bar when clicking anywhere outside of the navigation, improving the overall user experience. This eliminates the need for users to click the close/cross button, which can often be annoying and adds an extra step.
- **Scroll to Top:** A button that appears when you scroll down the page, allowing users to quickly return to the top.
- **GitHub Linked Projects:** Links to my GitHub repositories from individual project sections for users to view the code behind each project.
- **Hyperlinks:** Links to external websites and sections within the portfolio for easy navigation.
- **Resume Download:** A button that allows users to download my resume directly from the website.
- **GitHub/LinkedIn Hyperlinks:** Direct links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles for easy access.
- **Hover Features:** Interactive hover effects for buttons, links, and project cards to improve user engagement.
- **Favicon Added:** A custom favicon that appears in the browser tab for easy site identification.
- **Dynamic Column Layout:** The project list changes from a 3-column layout to a 1-column layout when viewed on mobile, improving accessibility and usability.
- **Email Button:** A button that opens the user's default email client to easily send me an email.
